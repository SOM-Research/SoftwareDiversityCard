# Software Diversity Card 

Welcome to the main repository of the Software Diversity Card (SDC). This repository contains a set of tools that helps you generate the cards for your software projects, generating both the JSON and Markdown formats to share with the world. 

The SDC is a comprehensive approach to disclosing diversity information about the teams involved in the development and governance of the project, the user groups engaged in testing, and the specific software adaptations for different social groups. The card aims to foster inclusive practices in open-source communities, public administrations, and businesses. The SDC is part of an ongoing research, preprint **TBA**

The best way to start is trying the webeditor [**online demo**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JoanGiner/SoftwareDiversityCard-Generator). 


## Repository Structure

This repository comprises a language plugin for Visual Studio Code, developed with Langium, and a web-form editor developed with Streamlit. If you are interested in the web-form editor, please go directly to the **Web Editor** section

### :page_with_curl: A language plugin for Visual Studio Code
The following tree shows the list of the repository's relevant sections:

  -   The *examples* folder contains an example of a software diversity card created using the DSL.
  - The *src* folder contains the project's source code:
    - The *cli* folder is the grammar and AST generated by Langium. You may not want to dive into it because it is a generated asset.
    The *extension* folder contains all the code for the generation service. It could be a good place to start if you want to improve the tool's generation.
    - The *language* folder contains all the language features, and the grammar declaration. If you want to improve the grammar, or some of the features the plugin offers, here is the place to start.

#### Usage examples:

In the *examples* folders, you can find two examples of Software Diversity Card instances described using the plugin of two mature open-source projects involving different groups of people. The two projects are [Decidim](https://decidim.org/), a participatory software used by over 400 administrations worldwide to allow citizens to participate in public decisions, and [Besser](http://besser-pearl.org/), a low-code platform designed to enable non-coding profiles to develop software applications in various domains. Despite their distinct characteristics, such as target users, both projects are open-source, publicly funded, and part of a user community.

We hope these examples could help you use the tools. If you have any other questions, do not hesitate to open an issue.

### :computer: Web editor

If you want to create the card using the web editor, all the code and installation instructions are in the /web_editor folder. 

Please note that we also have an open demo of the web editor [**here**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JoanGiner/SoftwareDiversityCard-Generator).
